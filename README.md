- Monitoring and alerting

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Microsoft Fabric workspace
- Appropriate Fabric capacity (F2 or higher recommended)
- Basic knowledge of Python and SQL
- (Optional) Git repository for CI/CD examples

### Running the Notebooks

1. **In Microsoft Fabric:**
   - Upload notebooks to your Fabric workspace
   - Attach to a lakehouse
   - Run cells sequentially

2. **Locally with Jupyter:**
   - Clone this repository
   - Install required packages: `pip install pandas numpy pyspark`
   - Open notebooks in Jupyter Lab/Notebook

## üìñ Learning Path

For a structured learning experience, we recommend following the notebooks in this order:

1. **Start with OneLake** to understand the foundational storage layer
2. **Explore Real-Time Intelligence** for streaming scenarios
3. **Learn Power BI Semantic Models** for reporting and analytics
4. **Master Data Pipelines** for orchestration and automation
5. **Implement CI/CD** to operationalize your solutions
