# Module 9: Advanced Scenarios and Best Practices

## Overview

This module covers advanced patterns, best practices, and real-world scenarios for deploying agentic workloads in production.

## Duration
‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 2-3 hours

## Topics Covered

### 1. Industry-Specific Agent Implementations

#### Financial Services Agent
- Fraud detection and alerting
- Automated compliance reporting
- Portfolio analysis and recommendations

#### Healthcare Agent
- Patient data analysis
- Appointment scheduling optimization
- Medical research assistance

#### Retail Agent
- Inventory optimization
- Demand forecasting
- Personalized marketing campaigns

#### Manufacturing Agent
- Predictive maintenance
- Supply chain optimization
- Quality control automation

### 2. Security and Governance

**Key Principles**:
- Use Managed Identities instead of service principals
- Implement Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Audit all agent actions
- Rate limiting and quota management

**Implementation**:
```python
# Example: Secure agent with managed identity
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential

class SecureAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Use managed identity instead of API keys
        self.credential = ManagedIdentityCredential()
        
    def access_fabric(self):
        token = self.credential.get_token(
            "https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default"
        )
        # Use token for API calls
```

### 3. Cost Optimization Strategies

**Techniques**:
1. **Model Selection**: Use GPT-3.5-turbo for simple tasks, GPT-4 for complex reasoning
2. **Prompt Caching**: Cache common prompts and responses
3. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple items in single API calls
4. **Token Optimization**: Minimize prompt lengths
5. **Budget Limits**: Set hard limits on spending

**Implementation**:
```python
class CostOptimizedAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token_budget = 100000  # Monthly limit
        self.tokens_used = 0
        
    def should_use_gpt4(self, task_complexity: float) -> bool:
        # Use cheaper model when possible
        return task_complexity > 0.7
```

### 4. Hybrid Agent Architectures

Combine rule-based systems with AI agents:

```python
class HybridAgent:
    def process(self, request):
        # Rule-based for simple cases
        if self.can_handle_with_rules(request):
            return self.rule_based_handler(request)
        
        # AI agent for complex cases
        return self.ai_agent_handler(request)
```

### 5. Agent Deployment Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Continuous Monitoring Agent
```python
# Runs continuously, monitoring for anomalies
while True:
    data = fetch_latest_data()
    if agent.detect_anomaly(data):
        agent.take_action()
    time.sleep(60)
```

#### Pattern 2: Event-Driven Agent
```python
# Triggered by events from Event Streams
@event_handler("fabric.data.updated")
def on_data_update(event):
    agent.process(event.data)
```

#### Pattern 3: Scheduled Agent
```python
# Runs on schedule via Data Factory pipeline
@schedule("0 0 * * *")  # Daily at midnight
def daily_report_agent():
    agent.generate_report()
```

### 6. Performance Optimization

**Techniques**:
- Parallel agent execution
- Async processing with asyncio
- Connection pooling
- Result caching
- Load balancing across agents

```python
import asyncio

async def parallel_agent_execution(tasks):
    # Run multiple agents in parallel
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        agent.process_async(task) for task in tasks
    ])
    return results
```

### 7. Testing and Validation

**Test Framework**:
```python
class AgentTestSuite:
    def test_accuracy(self):
        # Test agent responses against ground truth
        pass
    
    def test_latency(self):
        # Ensure agents meet SLA
        pass
    
    def test_cost(self):
        # Validate cost constraints
        pass
    
    def test_security(self):
        # Ensure no data leaks
        pass
```

### 8. Disaster Recovery

**Strategies**:
- Agent state backups
- Failover mechanisms
- Circuit breakers
- Graceful degradation

### 9. Agent Evolution

**Continuous Improvement**:
```python
class EvolvingAgent:
    def learn_from_feedback(self, feedback):
        # Collect feedback
        self.feedback_log.append(feedback)
        
        # Periodic model updates
        if len(self.feedback_log) > 100:
            self.retrain_model()
```

### 10. Integration Patterns

**Integrating with External Systems**:
- REST APIs
- Message queues (Event Hubs, Service Bus)
- Webhooks
- Azure Functions
- Logic Apps

## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Intelligent Data Pipeline Manager
An agent that monitors data pipelines, predicts failures, and automatically fixes issues.

### Use Case 2: Automated Report Generator
Multi-agent system that collects data, performs analysis, and generates executive reports.

### Use Case 3: Customer Support Agent
Agent that handles support tickets, queries data, and provides solutions.

### Use Case 4: Predictive Maintenance Orchestrator
Agents that monitor equipment data, predict failures, and trigger maintenance workflows.
