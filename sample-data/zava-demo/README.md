## Data Relationships

```
customers (1) ----< orders (M)
                      |
                      | (1)
                      |
                      < (M) order_items (M) >---- (1) products
```

## Usage Examples

### Reading with Python (pandas)
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read customers data
customers_df = pd.read_parquet('customers.parquet')
print(customers_df.head())

# Read all tables
tables = {
    'customers': pd.read_parquet('customers.parquet'),
    'products': pd.read_parquet('products.parquet'),
    'orders': pd.read_parquet('orders.parquet'),
    'order_items': pd.read_parquet('order_items.parquet'),
    'sales_performance': pd.read_parquet('sales_performance.parquet')
}
```

### Reading with Python (pyarrow)
```python
import pyarrow.parquet as pq

# Read customers data
table = pq.read_table('customers.parquet')
print(table.schema)
df = table.to_pandas()
```

### Using in Microsoft Fabric
1. Upload these parquet files to your Fabric Lakehouse
2. Create shortcuts or copy files to the Files section
3. Use Notebooks or SQL to query the data
4. Build reports and dashboards in Power BI

### Sample Queries

**Get top 10 customers by total spending:**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Get sales by category:**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price * (1 - oi.discount)) as revenue
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY revenue DESC
```

## Notes

- All data is randomly generated for demonstration purposes
- Date ranges: 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31 for orders and 2022-2024 for products
- Data includes realistic relationships between tables
- Parquet format provides efficient storage and fast query performance
- Files are compressed and optimized for analytical workloads
